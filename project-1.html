      <div class="proj-copy">
        <p class="body-copy">Put together by the 2014-2015 photojournalism class of Burnaby North Secondary, this 376-paged annual was themed to inspire the student body in the act of creating themselves and their future. The cover was designed so that when opened flat and read left to right (back to front), it reads “Vikings Create”, a message to staff and students alike that each days is a new day.</p>

      <img class="img-proj" src="img/yrbk-cover.jpg" alt="the front and back covers of Burnaby North Secondary's 2015 Yearbook, called Create. The covers are white with pastel coloured squares scattered across and hand-drawn icons of lightbulbs in some of the squares.">

      <h2 class="proj-sub-header">Roles & Goals</h2>
      <div class="proj-copy">
        <p class="body-copy">As an Editor-in-Chief, it was mine and my Co-Editor’s responsibility to come up with the theme that would drive this publication forwards, as well as to design the accompanying elements such as colour scheme, fonts, photo actions, and layouts of each and every page.</p>

        <p class="body-copy">Looking at the last several years’ annuals, the team could see that from 2011-2012, there was a leap in the style of Burnaby North’s yearbooks from a classic, old-school aesthetic, to a more graphic style. but from 2012 onwards, the annuals had fallen into a near cut-and-paste format.</p>

        <p class="body-copy">The question we asked ourselves then, was how can our team set apart this volume from the previous in a way that reflects the 2014-2015 Burnaby North community?</p>

        <p class="body-copy red">The goal approaching this project, essentially, was to set a new standard for the photojournalism classes to come.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="proj-sub-header">Process</h2>
      <div class="proj-copy">
        <p class="body-copy">Before we could get to the fun of designing, as editors, Amaara and I had to determine the page distribution of the entire publication. Working with our advisor, we created a page ladder of sticky-notes to visually represent this to the rest of the team.</p>

        <p class="body-copy">Brainstorming the theme Create, Amaara and I did extensive research and ideating, drawing inspiration heavily from the annuals of universities (Trinity Western’s in particular), lifestyle magazines such as Cereal and Kinfolk, and our good friend, Pinterest.</p>

        <p class="body-copy">We wanted to communicate this idea of creating by having elements that highlighted both the classic fine arts approach (the hand-drawn icons) as well as the newer digital medium (the colour blocking and box outlines on the divider pages). This, for us, was to demonstrate creativity among different mediums, and to furthermore show how past and present forms can work together to push us forwards.</p>
      </div>

      <img class="img-proj" src="img/yrbk-activities.jpg" alt="The divider page of the Activities section of the yearbook: featuring a photo of the school's mascot, a viking, laughing beside a male student. There is an transparent aqua overlay on the left page containing hand-drawn icons of a cupcake, a microphone, and a jack-o-lantern; icons representative of some of the activities that the section's pages feature.">

      <div class="proj-copy">
        <p class="body-copy">While this was a collaborative project, the elements that I specifically designed include:</p>
        <ul class="list-proj-info">
          <li>the front cover</li>
          <li>the “intro/outro” pages</li>
          <li>the layouts of the student life</li>
          <li>the layouts of the staff</li>
          <li>the layouts of the activities</li>
          <li>the layouts of the sports</li>
          <li>the layouts of the grad events</li>
          <li>the autograph pages</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="body-copy">I also did the illustrations of the section icons, excluding the light bulb, and each team member was required to contribute to the photography of the annual. My photos are primarily featured in the student life, activities and grad activities sections.</p>
      </div>

      <img class="img-proj" src="img/yrbk-sports.jpg" alt="An example of a sports spread. This features the girls' soccer team. The spread includes a large feature photo of a player in action, as well as smaller team photos and other action shots of the girls.">

      <h2 class="proj-sub-header">Looking Back</h2>
      <div class="proj-copy">
        <p class="body-copy">While constraints from our advisor kept us from realizing the exact vision we had had for this publication, I strongly believe that the resulting annual communicates visually and verbally as well as it would have had we been given free reign.</p>

        <p class="body-copy">From this process, I have not only learned how to conceptualize, communicate, and realize an idea within given deadlines and constraints, but how to better work with a large team in a position of leadership — something I had not had the opportunity to experience until this project.</p>
