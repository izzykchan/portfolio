        <p class="body-copy">Put together by the 2014-2015 photojournalism class of Burnaby North Secondary, this 376-paged annual was themed to inspire the student body in the act of creating themselves and their future. The cover was designed so that when opened flat and read left to right (back to front), it reads “Vikings Create”, a message to staff and students alike that each days is a new day.</p>

      <h2 class="proj-sub-header">Role & Responsibilities</h2>
      <div class="proj-copy">
        <p class="body-copy">As one of two Editor-in-Chiefs of Create, it was mine and my co-editor’s responsibility to come up with the theme that would drive this publication forwards, as well as to design the accompanying elements such as colour scheme, fonts, photo actions, and the layouts of each and every page. We also had the responsibility of overseeing a team of 14 other students; ensuring that their designated pages were completed and up to standards by the deadlines we assigned to them — so as not to delay our print date with the publisher, Friesens.</p>

        <ul class="list-proj-info">While this was a collaborative project, the elements that I specifically designed include:
          <li>the front cover</li>
          <li>the “intro/outro” pages</li>
          <li>the layouts of the student life</li>
          <li>the layouts of the staff</li>
          <li>the layouts of the activities</li>
          <li>the layouts of the sports</li>
          <li>the layouts of the grad events</li>
          <li>the autograph pages</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="body-copy">I also did the illustrations of the section icons, excluding the light bulb, and each team member was required to contribute to the photography of the annual. My photos are primarily featured in the student life, activities and grad activities sections.</p>

      <img class="img-proj" src="img/yrbk-activities.jpg" alt="The divider page of the Activities section of the yearbook: featuring a photo of the school's mascot, a viking, laughing beside a male student. There is an transparent aqua overlay on the left page containing hand-drawn icons of a cupcake, a microphone, and a jack-o-lantern.">

      <h2 class="proj-sub-header">Objective</h2>
      <div class="proj-copy">
        <p class="body-copy">My personal goal regarding the theme of the yearbook was to create a new standard for the photojournalism classes to come. Wanting to break from the previous years' more traditional looks, Amaara and I pushed for a riskier, but more modern style. The vision was a cleaner, whiter, simpler aesthetic.</p>

        <h2 class="proj-sub-header">Process</h2>
        <div class="proj-copy">
          <p class="body-copy">Before we could begin thinking about how each page would look, we had to decide what exactly was going to be on which page. Working with our advisor, Amaara and I created a page ladder of sticky-notes to visually represent the annual's page distribution to the rest of the team.</p>

          <p class="body-copy">Following the logistics, Amaara and I brainstormed various themes, colour schemes, and other potential elements that these ideas could bring. Agreeing upon Create, we then had to pitch the concept to the team.</p>

          <p class="body-copy">Gaining their support, we were able to move on to more specific graphic design and page layouts — for which we worked in parralel processes.</p>

          <img class="img-proj" src="img/yrbk-sports.jpg" alt="An example of a sports spread. This features the girls' soccer team. The spread includes a large feature photo of a player in action, as well as smaller team photos and other action shots of the girls.">

          <p class="body-copy">I began creating sets of page templates with an accompanying checklist for peers to follow, which included all technical specifications such as page margins, columns, fonts, gutters, photo treatment, naming conventions, etc. </p>

          <p class="body-copy">As the templates came into play, well over 30 iterations of the cover were drafted by Amaara and myself. Narrowing down the mock-ups, we pitched our top three designs to the team for feedback and made a final decision.</p>

          <p class="body-copy">With these foundational elements finalized, we fell into the routine of distribute deadlines (determine which sections needed how many pages done by different deadlines), revise spreads (check over content, proof-read copy, and go through the checklist -- if there were corrections to be made, spreads would be handed back to be fixed), get Ms. Teng-Davis' final approval, and upload the documents to the publishing company's site.</p>

        <div class="proj-copy">
          <p class="body-copy">The conception of Create allowed me to understand "the big picture" in a production such as this; how each element, each section, each page interact with one another to shape the overall experience had by its viewers.
