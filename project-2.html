        <p class="body-copy">A lower division Publishing project in which students were tasked with creating a brochure for an event or company that would entice the respective target audience to engage with said event/company. For this project, I partnered with Burnaby Karate Academy — a pre-existing client of mine.</p>

        <h2 class="proj-sub-header">Process</h2>
        <div class="proj-copy">
          <p class="body-copy">Upon choosing a client, I decided to conduct a quick brand analysis of Burnaby Karate Academy to clarify the goals and values of the company as well as to determine the target audience that I would be designing for.</p>

          <p class="body-copy">The analysis showed that Burnaby Karate Academy values  respect for oneself, one’s peers, and one’s environment, hard work, and determination as is reflected in their motto, “kindness, courage, excellence.” They promote themselves as a family, with programs that range from introductory and skill-developing for young children, to more engaging and physical for ~9+ ages, to elite-level sport competition.</p>

          <p class="body-copy">This makes for a large audience, however owner of BKA, Sandeep Gill, notes that the majority of the club’s population is of the younger demographic; but as the children grow up, they can choose if they would like to continue leisurely or go competitive.</p>

          <img class="img-proj" src="img/yrbk-sports.jpg" alt="An example of a sports spread. This features the girls' soccer team. The spread includes a large feature photo of a player in action, as well as smaller team photos and other action shots of the girls.">

          <p class="body-copy">From this, I could conclude that the market audience is — not exclusively, but primarily — parents with young children.</p>

          <p class="body-copy">I had to question, how then can I promote this club and this sport and set it apart from the alternative activities that parents would likely enrol their children in, such as soccer and baseball?</p>

          <p class="body-copy">When picking content, I decided to emphasize the value of character that BKA promotes and strives for, as well as the success of the club in the sport, as this could be a point of intrigue and/or inspiration to potential members.</p>

          <p class="body-copy">Designing the brochure itself, I followed the branding of the company using the colours of black, white and red with the majority of the copy being in a serif typeface. I applied a modern style design to these more traditional elements in attempt to communicate the practices of the club, which essentially are a modern interpretation of an ancient Japanese culture.</p>
