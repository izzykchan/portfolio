      <div class="proj-copy">
        <p class="body-copy">A lower division Publishing project in which students were tasked with creating a brochure for an event or company that would entice the respective target audience to engage with said event/company. For this project, I partnered with Burnaby Karate Academy — a pre-existing client of mine.</p>
      </div>

      <img class="img-proj brochure-cover" src="img/brochure-cover-full.png" alt="the cover of an informative pamphlet for the karate club, Burnaby Karate Academy. It features the club's logo, a lion head, with a photo of a female athlete in action, kicking.">

      <h2 class="proj-sub-header">Roles & Goals</h2>
      <div class="proj-copy">
        <p class="body-copy">As this was a solo project, I had to determine on my own how to visually and verbally communicate the goals and personality of the company in order to intrigue potential customers.</p>

        <p class="body-copy red">I had to question, how can I promote this club and this sport and set it apart from the alternative activities that parents would likely enrol their children in, such as soccer and baseball?</p>
      </div>

      <img class="img-proj" src="img/brochure-back-full.png" alt="The inside pages of the karate club pamphlet. It features a full bleed photo on the left panel of a child in a karate uniform, informative text and an image of one of the club's athletes (Jusleen Virk) on the podium at the 2015 Pan American Games in the middle panel, and on the right panel another image of a teen athlete in action along with hours of operation and a map to the club.">

      <h2 class="proj-sub-header">Process</h2>
      <div class="proj-copy">
        <p class="body-copy">Having chosen my client, I conducted a quick brand analysis of Burnaby Karate Academy to clarify the goals and values of the company as well as to determine the target audience that I would be designing for.</p>

        <p class="body-copy">The analysis showed that Burnaby Karate Academy values respect for oneself, one’s peers, and one’s environment, hard work, and determination as is reflected in their motto, “kindness, courage, excellence.” They promote themselves as a family, with programs that range from introductory and skill-developing for young children, to more engaging and physical for ~9+ ages, to elite-level sport competition.</p>

        <p class="body-copy">This makes for a large audience, however owner of BKA (Burnaby Karate Academy), Sandeep Gill, notes that the majority of the club’s population is of the younger demographic; but as the children grow up, they can choose if they would like to continue leisurely or go competitive.</p>

        <img class="img-proj img-brochure-process" src="img/brochure-process.jpg" alt="An image of the pamphlet in process. A notebook lays open with sketches and notes, and test prints of draft layouts are scattered overtop.">
      </div>

      <div class="proj-copy">
        <p class="body-copy">When picking content, I decided to emphasize the value of character that BKA promotes and strives for, as well as the success of the club in the sport, as this could be a point of intrigue and/or inspiration to potential members.</p>

        <p class="body-copy">Designing the brochure itself, I followed the branding of the company using the colours of black, white and red with the majority of the copy being in a serif typeface. I applied a modern style design to these more traditional elements in attempt to communicate the practices of the club, which essentially are a modern interpretation of an ancient Japanese culture.</p>

      <h2 class="proj-sub-header">Takeaways</h2>
      <div class="proj-copy">
        <p class="body-copy">Creating an article for an existing company enabled me to learn how to design within pre-existing brand components, rather than starting from scratch with complete creative control as most other projects have allowed thus far in my career.</p>

        <p class="body-copy">As well, this has made me more aware of how verbal and visual language work together to communicate, and how they can (and should) be tailored depending on the target audience.</p>
